- Streanths-
        - I love my work, and i enjoy to do that.
        - I can handle the presure with deadlines.
        - I can work with patience.

- Weaknesses - 
        - Sometimes i get curiuos about things, and i start to explore them, and sometimes those things might not be that important. 
        Though i do that in my free time but still it takes resources.
